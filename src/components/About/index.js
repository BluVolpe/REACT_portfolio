          <p>
            I recently graduated the UCF Coding Boot Camp. I am excited to enter the field of coding and build beautiful websites.

            I started out as a budget analyst in the US Air Force and wound up in the electricians career field afterwards. Being in blazing hot attics in the summers of florida was not as great as it sounded when i first became an electrician. I then entered the coding boot camp to dive in to the programming world that I've admired since a child. I love everything about computers and video games and I want to contribute to that world as a profession.
